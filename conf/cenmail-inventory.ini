# A section per id, defining:
#   - subject: a string, interpreted as a template
#   - template: the name of the template file defining the contents
#     (for the id [foo], the default value is "template: foo", which
#     indicate file templates/cenmails/foo.tpl).
#   - This is a usual Python's configuration consequently the DEFAULT
#     feature and the substitution mechanism of configuration file
#     should be used when appropriate.
