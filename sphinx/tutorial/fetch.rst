This tutorial will guide you throughout writing a simple script
running an AROME forecast.

1. Fetching data
****************

Throughout this tutorial we separate input data into three groups:

Dynamic data
    Data that is generated as part of a NWP workflow.  Dynamic data is
    usually specific to a forecast start date and/or term. Also known
    as *flow data*. Exemples: lateral boundary conditions,
    initial condition.

Static data
    Data that is generated once and for all, usually
    indepently of any NWP pipeline.  Also known as *constant data*.
    Examples: altitude and surface climatology data.

Configuration files
    One or more files required by the target program.
    Also known as *namelist files*. They usually are Fortran
    NAMELIST files or JSON data.
    

A data file's group will impact some of the parameters passed to
vortex's ``input`` function.  For instance, retrieving dynamic data
requires specifying a source NWP experiment that generated the data:
itself, a colleague's, or a given operational run.  On the other hand,
retrieving static data will require specifying a version tag for the
NWP suite, also known as *cycle*.

    
1.1 Fetching dynamic data
=========================

In order to run an AROME forecast, we need to fetch the following
dynamic data:

Initial condition
    A data file in the FA format, usually generated by the "coupling"
    task of the NWP pipeline

Lateral boundary conditions
    A collection of FA data files, usually generated by the "coupling"
    task of the NWP pipeline.  One file per term.

Surface guess
    Surface initial condition generated by the SURFEX sofware.

This tutorial assumes that you went through the configuration step
required to setup communication with

1.1.1 Initial condition
-----------------------

We'll start with fetching the initial condition file from the archive.
